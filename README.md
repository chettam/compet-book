There is a very nice book called "**Competitive Programmer's Handbook**":

[https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf)

The objective of this website is to try to translate it into Kazakh language to widespread the book amongst high schools and universities students.

No one is getting paid for this work, it is a completely non-profit and community driven effort mainly managed by a small group of kazakh software developers from around the world who wants to contribute and giveback to their home-country and future generations of IT specialists.

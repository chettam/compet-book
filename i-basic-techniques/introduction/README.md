# Introduction

Competitive programming combines two topics: \(1\) the design of algorithms and \(2\) the implementation of algorithms.

The **design of algorithms** consists of problem solving and mathematical thinking. Skills for analyzing problems and solving them creatively are needed. An algorithm for solving a problem has to be both correct and efficient, and the core of the problem is often about inventing an efficient algorithm.

Theoretical knowledge of algorithms is important to competitive programmers. Typically, a solution to a problem is a combination of well-known techniques and new insights. The techniques that appear in competitive programming also form the basis for the scientific research of algorithms.

The **implementation of algorithms** requires good programming skills. In competitive programming, the solutions are graded by testing an implemented algorithm using a set of test cases. Thus, it is not enough that the idea of the algorithm is correct, but the implementation also has to be correct.

A good coding style in contests is straightforward and concise. Programs should be written quickly, because there is not much time available. Unlike in traditional software engineering, the programs are short \(usually at most a few hundred lines of code\), and they do not need to be maintained after the contest.
